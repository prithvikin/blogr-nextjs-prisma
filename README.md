# FitBlog: A Fitness Blog for Everyone
Final Project for Introduction to Health Infomatics by Prithvi Kinariwala

Try FitBlog here: (https://fitblog.vercel.app/)

This project uses Next.js and Prisma, is hosted on Vercel, and used the quickstart documentation from Next.js. User authentication is done with GitHub OAuth. The PostgresSQL backend is hosted using Supabase. The leaderboard is refreshed with a Cron Job that executes every 10 minutes.

FitBlog is an interactive Blog to get individuals social about their physical exercises. After completing physical activity, users can create draft posts to be published to the FitBlog public feed. Users earn one point for every 30 minutes an activity lasts. The leaderboard depicts the point totals for all global users.

Documentation is under `/Documentation`.
